a) Frequency test              - Tests the proportions of ones to zeros in the entire data sequence. Truly random data should contain 50% ones and 50% zeros (or really close to that amount).
   Frequency test within block - Same as above, but intead of entire data sequence it checks in M-bit blocks.
b) e = 11111111 00000010, n = 16, M = 8, N = 2
c) Freq. test - p = 0.6170751... >= 0.01 -> sequence is random
   Block test - p = 0.0019305... <  0.01 -> sequence is non-random
