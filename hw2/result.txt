3. ###########
D3 = I created a random message of length 4 where c = 32. Than I created a hash of this massege nad store it.
    In a cycle a create a new hash from the previosly created one and store its value until we find that
    a newly created hash is identical with one of the hashes that is stored already in a memory.

    I generate the message randomly so this is just an example.

m3 = 35CE14E6
m4 = 0DBF82E8
c = 32
hash34 = 6E9ED255
